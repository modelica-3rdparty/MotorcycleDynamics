# MotorcycleDynamics
Free library for the dynamic simulation of a motorcycle, and tailored to test and validation of active control systems for motorcycle dynamics.

## Library description

This library is used to model motorcycle chassis. This library models complex phenomena that characterize
 the vehicles dynamics with two wheels. The modeling process of physical reality has made to emerge three principal entity:
- Body: it understands the pilot end the chassis of motorcycle (suspension, wheel, steering gear,...);
- Road: it is the modelling of road where the motorcycle stir;
- Wheel-road interaction: it interface the two preceding components, it simulate present forces of contact
